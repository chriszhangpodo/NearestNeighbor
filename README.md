# NearestNeighbor
simple code for NearestNeighbor

This is the simplest algorithem which called NearestNeighbor 
did not wrote the data input convertor
User need to input the data as array 

Please share and copy responsibly and all faults and errors in implementation is due to user's own responsibility 

See the pictures in trained data and predicted data distance is quite small, that is how we calculate the prediction
